            <p>My summer abroad in Europe was truly an amazing experience. I took a course at London School of Economics, Real Estate Finance. I really enjoyed the class, it was stuff I found very interesting to learn about. I also really liked the school and teaching structure. However, since it was a summer class, we had 3 hour long classes every day and a recitation after, so it was a little draining.</p>
            
            <p>My friend and I did our best to maximize our experiences while prioritizing our class as well. We went to London about 2 weeks before our class started, and travelled to Florence and Barcelona and spent some time exploring London.</p>
            
            <p>Florence was so beautiful, we saw so many beautiful sights, ate authentic Italian food at delicious restaurants, and took a lot of pictures. In Barcelona, we travelled to a beautiful big beach and saw one of a kind sights. We went to other beaches as well and had a great time. The environment was so fun and free and I could see myself visiting again for sure. </p>
            
            <p>This experience has made me fall in love with travelling and I want to visit a lot of places, including Morocco, Greece, Paris, Thailand, Amsterdam, South Korea, Austria, Sri Lanka, and more.</p>
